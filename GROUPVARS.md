# Group vars

The `group_vars` file can be used to set variables to control the
common configuration for of all ipfs and ipfs-cluster peers.

Edit the `ipfs.yml` file in this folder and set the appropiate values for the
variables.

Note the cluster `service.json` template can be fully customized by defining
the appropiate variables, and otherwise they will take sensisble defaults.
